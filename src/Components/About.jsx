        <p className='text-justify'>Hello World! I'm Himanshu Sekhar Behera , a Full Stack Developer based out of odisha.
        <br /><br />I am a skilled web designer with over 3 years of experience in the industry. My passion lies in creating captivating website designs and implementing them through frontend development. I take pride in staying up-to-date with current design trends and leveraging my creativity to produce visually appealing and user-friendly websites. Throughout my career, I have developed a deep understanding ofReactjs and Java
       <br /><br /> I started programming back in 2020's and with lots of twists and turns I felt in love with ReactJs, currently I'm trying my hands on backend stuff which includes Node and Mongo. Making interactive, beautiful and simple websites is my farmost concern right now.

<br /><br />When it comes to designing the website, Tailwind hits my mind and is my current obession. This is my favourite part in web development and I think it makes me a better thinker doing so and I'm looking forward to broad my horizon by gaining some real world experience.</p>
